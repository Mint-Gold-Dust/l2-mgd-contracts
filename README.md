## Mint Gold Dust (MGD) L2 Smart Contracts Suite

**MGD is a decentralized NFT ecosystem built for artists and collectors.**

This repository contains the smart contracts that allow MGD to operate both in Ethereum and an Op-stack compatible layer 2 (such as [Base](https://base.org/) or [Optimism](https://www.optimism.io/).   

The smart contracts in this repositoy introduce the following high level functionality:

-   **NFT Portability**: Bring your MGD NFTs from Ethereum to the L2 or viceverse via an escrow-voucher contract system.
-   **L2 Usability**: Create and/or sell / auction your art in more exciting and different ways, not to mention also affordable, by using the MGD L2 ecosystem.
-   **Simpler Transferability**: Approve the sell, auction or transfer of your NFTs with the use of "permits" or signatures, in place of the current additional "annoying" approval transaction.

## Documentation

General statements   
   
- The smart contracts in this repository are backward compatible (must be) with the MGD v2-core contracts.
- Ethereum is and will be MGD's ultimate layer of truth. This assures all our artists and collectors that their creations or collected art pieces will persist regardless of the direction any L2 takes in the future (including ceasing to exist).
