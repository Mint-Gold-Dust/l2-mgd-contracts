## Mint Gold Dust (MGD) L2 Contracts Suite

**MGD is a decentralized NFT ecosystem built for artists and collectors.**

This repository contains the smart contracts that allow MGD to operate both in Ethereum and a Op-stack (such as [Base](https://base.org/) or [Optimism](https://www.optimism.io/)) compatible layer 2.
The smart contracts in this repositoy introduce the following high level functionality:

-   **NFT Portability**: Bring your MGD NFTs from Ethereum to the L2 via an Escrow contract or viceverse.
-   **L2 Usability**: Create and/or sell your art in more and different ways, also affordable, by using the MGD L2 ecosystem.
-   **Simpler Transferability**: Sell, auction or transfer you NFTs with the use of `permit` or signatures, in place of the "annoying" approval transaction.

## Documentation

General statements   
   
- The smart contracts in this repository are backward compatible (must be) with the MGD v2-core contracts.
- Ethereum is and will be MGD's ultimate layer of truth. This assures all our artists and collectors that their creations or collected art pieces will persist regardless of the direction any L2 takes in the future (including ceasing to exist).
